## Resources

#### Docker Containers

You can use these container to reproduce the environment the authors used for this tutorial.  Incase it is helpful, I have provided a [requirements.txt](./requirements/requirements.txt) file, however, we highly recommend using the docker containers provided below as the dependencies can be complicated to build yourself.

 - [hamelsmu/ml-gpu](https://hub.docker.com/r/hamelsmu/ml-gpu/): Use this container for any *gpu* bound parts of the tutorial.  We recommend running the entire tutorial on an aws `p3.8xlarge` and using this image.

 - [hamelsmu/ml-cpu](https://hub.docker.com/r/hamelsmu/ml-cpu/): Use this container for any *cpu* bound parts of this tutorial.


 #### Notebooks

 The [notebooks](./notebooks) folder contains 5 Jupyter notebooks that correspond to Parts 1-5 of the tutorial.
